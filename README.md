# co2_capture
H2S and CO2 are captured using low-temperature, high-pressure absorption techniques, whereas desorption takes place at high temperatures and low pressures, resulting in repeated temperature variations, a phenomenon called "cold fever". The captured CO2 then has to be dried and compressed to fulfill the criteria for its transportation and storage, requiring additional, repetitive efforts.

Utilizing the varying boiling points of the components in IGCC syngas, cryogenic distillation facilitates the removal of H2S and CO2 through a sequence of multi-compression, condensation, and separation processes. This process, modeled with the Aspen Plus software, starts with water removal through flashing, followed by H2S removal in a desulfurization tower, and CO2 removal in a decarburization tower.

Optimizations of tower parameters, including the reflux ratio, the number of stages, and the feed stage location, are conducted to evaluate their effects on the efficiency of H2S and CO2 removal. In optimized scenarios, cryogenic distillation has been compared to traditional absorption methods (Rectisol, Selexol, Purisol, and MDEA), showcasing its ability to eliminate 85% of CO2, 98.2% of H2S, and 100% of NH3 from syngas, facilitating an integrated approach to carbon capture and storage without the need for repeated processing. Furthermore, the process achieves an impressive 99.94% CO2 purity level, surpassing transportation and storage standards.

One of the major advantages of cryogenic distillation is its operation without the need for absorbents, thus eliminating the need for solvent regeneration and minimizing loss. The process is notably straightforward, involving just two towers for effective gas separation and offering a cost-effective solution. This presents a significant opportunity for simplifying the removal of H2S and CO2 from IGCC syngas, streamlining the operation, eliminating the need for repetitive tasks and solvent use, and reducing both energy use and costs.
